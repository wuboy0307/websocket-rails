###
WebsocketRails JavaScript Client

Setting up the dispatcher:
  var dispatcher = new WebSocketRails('localhost:3000/websocket');
  dispatcher.on_open = function() {
    // trigger a server event immediately after opening connection
    dispatcher.trigger('new_user',{user_name: 'guest'});
  })

Triggering a new event on the server
  dispatcherer.trigger('event_name',object_to_be_serialized_to_json);

Listening for new events from the server
  dispatcher.bind('event_name', function(data) {
    console.log(data.user_name);
  });

Stop listening for new events from the server
  dispatcher.unbind('event')
